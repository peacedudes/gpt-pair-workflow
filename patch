 Clipboard-first workflow to collaborate with GPT on any git repo.
 
-Getting started (scratch repo)
-- Create a small temporary git repo with only sample files (no private content).
-- In that repo, run:
+Getting started (this repo)
+- In this Quick Start repo, run:
 ```bash
 scripts/sharefiles
 ```
-Paste the clipboard into a new GPT chat to initialize the session.
-The assistant will then request small peeks (read-only file slices) and return unified diffs to apply.
-Follow the Peek → Patch → Apply → Test loop once or twice in the scratch repo.
+Paste the clipboard into a new GPT chat to initialize the session. This primes the assistant with these scripts and docs.
+The assistant will then request small peeks (read-only slices) and return unified diffs to apply here.
 
 When comfortable
