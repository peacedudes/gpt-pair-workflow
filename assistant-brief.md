Title: VoiceLogin — Assistant Brief

Context
- App: VoiceLogin (Swift/SwiftUI/SwiftData)
- Primary target OS: iOS 17+ (and/or macOS.  TV or Watch: stretch)
- Xcode: 26.0 (beta)
- Swift: 6 (strict actor isolation)

Goals (ranked)
1) Make easy, bulletproof, highly functional API for general purpose voice input and output.
2) Keep the near-zero delay between “Thank you,” and clip playback.
3) Keep tests green and fast; no flaky behavior.
4) Code changes delivered as full replacement files, in code blocks only.

Current issues
- Describe compile errors, runtime issues, and steps to reproduce (button spam, etc.)
    The output console has scary errors, that repeat.  I'm told they're harmless.  I'd rather they be gone:
        Potential Structural Swift Concurrency Issue: unsafeForcedSync called from Swift Concurrent context.
        IPCAUClient.cpp:139   IPCAUClient: can't connect to server (-66748)
        AVAudioBuffer.mm:281   mBuffers[0].mDataByteSize (0) should be non-zero
    There is a warning I'd like removed.  I've been told it's hard to fix and harmless.  It's on "player.scheduleBuffer(...)":
        /Users/rdoggett/Developer/Tests/VoiceLogin/VoiceLogin/VoiceIO.swift:479:16 Consider using asynchronous alternative function

Output rules
- Always use fenced code blocks for any code, never inline or prose-only patches.
- Avoid heavy formatting; short bullet lists OK.

Style
- File headers format:
```
  //
  //  <FileName>.swift
  //  VoiceLogin
  //
  //  Generated by GPT-5 (OpenAI) <any identifying build info available>
  //  collaborator: robert
  //  date: <MM-DD-YYYY>
  //
```
- Keep @MainActor correctness and Swift 6 isolation compliance.
- Prefer small, well-named helpers over long methods.

Testing
- Please provide as close to 100% code coverage as possible.
- Make tests serve as valuable and complete documentation on how to use.

Constraints
- No new dependencies without approval.
- Don’t change app behavior unless explicitly requested.

Privacy
- No secrets in repo. If needed, use placeholders and point them out.
