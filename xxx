# GPT Peek → Patch → Apply

Clipboard-first workflow to collaborate with GPT on any git repo.

Start here
```bash
scripts/sharefiles
```
Paste the clipboard into a GPT chat, then follow the Peek → Patch → Apply → Test loop.

Docs
- See docs/quick-start.md for the 2‑minute guide.

Privacy
- Don’t use this on private or unshareable repos without permission; file contents will be pasted into chat.

Non‑macOS
- Clipboard tools differ; ask GPT to adapt scripts if needed.
